#revolushen
We’ve all come across NGO stalls at various places, yet hesitation often holds us back from donating as we are driven by concerns about their legitimacy.
So we decided to start something of our own albeit currently in a small way to help others. We did market research, and found a problem that affects everyone to an extent and that was feminine hygiene. 
Despite its critical importance, it remains shrouded in taboo, often ignored in conversations and initiatives. We realized the urgent need to break the stigma and wanted to share with the world a simple yet profound truth that feminine hygiene is about health, dignity, and empowerment.
This led to two seventeen year olds, although confused about life, knew one thing for sure, that they wanted to make a change in a way in which they could.
That was how Revolushen took its root on paper and in our hearts.
Here at Revolushesn, our aim is simple, it’s about educating the underprivileged about simply yet imperative factors like hygiene, especially the women.
We further aid their journey by distributing feminine hygiene products like sanitary napkins and other essentials.
